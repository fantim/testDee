Hi! My name is Chen Jiarui, and I am 24 years old. I come from Wuxi, China. Currently, I am pursuing my studies at the Higher School of Economics in Russia, where I am majoring in Industrial Design.

My journey in Industrial Design began with a deep passion for creativity and innovation. I have always been fascinated by the process of transforming ideas into tangible products that can enhance people's lives. This led me to choose Industrial Design as my field of study, where I have been able to develop my skills in design thinking, product development, and user-centered design.

Throughout my academic career, I have worked on various projects that have allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. These experiences have not only honed my technical abilities but also improved my problem-solving and teamwork skills.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring different cultures and learning new languages, which is one of the reasons I chose to study in Russia. This international experience has broadened my perspective and enriched my understanding of global design trends.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my journey in Industrial Design, aiming to contribute innovative solutions to the industry. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals and bring fresh ideas to the table.

Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. I look forward to connecting and sharing more about my experiences and aspirations.
